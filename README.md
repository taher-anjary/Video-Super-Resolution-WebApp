Welcome to TecoGAN, an AI that will quadruple your video resolution using state of the art Generative-Adversarial-Networks.
Step 1:

Go to Edit>Notebook settings and make sure you have selected the run time as GPU. Click 'Save'

Step 2:

Run each code cell block below one by one, making sure that each completes before running the next one. The 'run' icon will appear if you hover your mouse over the very top-left corner of each code cell.

When you run the code cell with the command runMe(), an upload prompt will appear asking you to upload the video you want to enhance. Go ahead and browse to the desired video from your PC and let the AI do its work. After completing the conversion, your enhanced video will automatically download. Note that your orginal and enhanced video file will be deleted from COLAB servers automatically. Do not worry.

You may close this tab once you are done.

PS:

If you want to convert more videos, just run the *runME() code cell again AFTER the previous conversion has completed and your file has been downloaded

I take no credit for their work aside from tweaking their code to make it easier for others to use.
